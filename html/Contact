                        <h4>Main Research Takeaways</h4>
                        <p>Through usability testing and interviews, we were able to gather common themes amongst new users of HEARD:</p>
                        <div class="lists">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Even after signing up, parents still did not understand what HEARD was used for. </li>
                                <li>Parents were worried about privacy and found the amount of information requested by HEARD was off-putting, especially since it involved their children.</li>
                                <li>Parents questioned HEARD's legitimacy since their school name was absent from the e-mail invitation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>Current users of the app also complained that:</p>
                        <div class="lists">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Too many notifications received</li>
                                <li>Settings were hard to find and understand</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h4>Red Route Analysis Tool</h4>
                            <p>To figure out which aspects of the app we should focus on and highlight during the onboarding process, we used the "Red Route Analysis" tool. We created a list of tasks and sorted them by asking two questions:</p>
                                <div class="lists">
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>How many users need this function?</li>
                                        <li>How often do users use this function?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
