                    <p>Through our changes, we were able to get 100% of users to correctly identify the target market and were successful in getting 60% of users to correctly calculate the pricing for WeTravel. We made the pricing more transparent and easy to understand and also improved clarity on the landing page. By the end of our cycles, we were able to increase user engagement and clicks on the call to action button. </p>

                        <p> During our experimentation phase, we started with testing the control, which is the original and current WeTravel website. Using the control as the basis for our changes, we began four cycles:</p>
