                <div class="section">
                    <h3>Understanding the User</h3>
                        <p>Before starting the task, I needed to understand who I was designing for. Since Mercari is an app centered around the buying and selling of second-hand goods (with a majority of items being clothes and accessories), I made the assumption that their main demographic is females in their 20s and 30s.</p>
                        <br>    
                        <h4>USABILITY TESTING WITH TARGET MARKET TO UNDERSTAND BUYING HABITS</h4>
                            <p>I asked five females to think outloud and walk me through a hypothetical purchase using the original design. Here were a few insights I gathered from the tests:</p>
                    
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/mercarioriginal.jpg">
                        </figure>
                        <h4>CARD SORT TO UNDERSTAND USER VALUES</h4>
                        
                        <p>To understand what users felt were most important when making a purchasing decision, I did a card sort with eight females ranging in age from 24 to 32, who often shop online and have bought second-hand items.</p>
                        <figure class="cardsort">
                            <img src="../images/cardsort.jpg">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Here are some of my takeaways based on the card sort findings:</p>
                        <div class="lists">
                            <ul>
                                <li>People favored seeing the number of likes an item has over the ability to like an item themselves</li>
                                <li>People did not care too much about "Message Seller" although it is one of the main CTAs on the original screen</li>
                                <li>The photo is one of the most important items but is cluttered with other elements on top of it </li>
                                <li>Price is another element that is most important but it can be overlooked because of placement and size</li>
                                <li>Similar items ranked very low on the list but the "Similar Items" text is heavily bolded and is large in size, giving it a lot of prominence and may be distracting to the user</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
                            <p>To have a better understanding of the market, I looked at several popular ecommerce apps including Amazon, Ebay, Poshmark, OfferUp, Etsy, Tradesy and Wish to get an idea of what others were doing well and what could be improved.</p>
                            <div class="lists">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All of the apps placed heavy emphasis on the photos with photos taking up most of the retail space</li>
                                    <li>Some apps did a good job of creating a sense of urgency
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Wish uses "54 viewing now"</li>
                                            <li>Most apps also have a heart with number of likes</li>
                                            <li>Ebay tells users how many products have already been sold and how many are left</li>
                                            <li>A few apps also list the retail price so customers can see how much they're saving</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ways other apps increase purchasing confidence
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Amazon has tags for best sellers in each category (i.e. #1 best seller)</li>
                                            <li>Several apps also have a section for refund policy</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                            <p>To brainstorm different layouts, I created some wireframes. I put a lot of the emphasis on arranging the most important information in a way that makes sense.</p>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="../images/mercari_wireframes.jpg">

                                <div class="lists">
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Establish trust early and maintain trust throughout the process to increase purchasing confidence</li>
                                    <li>Improve text hierarchy and UI to make page easily comprehensible</li>

                          <h3>Takeaways</h3>  
                    <p>Redesigning the Mercari app was a fun challenge that I really enjoyed because the ecommerce industry is one I can personally relate to having started my own online store and a space I find very interesting. Having a good understanding of the user was very important and influenced a lot of the design decisions I made. Although I would be considered Mercari's target market since I am a young female who has used apps to shop, I made it a point not to design based on assumptions of my own shopping habits. I was surprised to learn through the card sorting that 'message the seller' ranked very low on the list, but was a main CTA in the original version. </p>
                            <p>If I were to move forward with this project, I would validate the new design through user testing and make additional iterations to it.</p>
                            <p> Thank you Mercari for giving me this opportunity to complete this fun design challenge! </p>
                            <h1>Bonus Challenge</h1>
                            <br>
                                <figure><img src="../images/xmas_ad.jpg">
                                </figure>
                            <br>
                                
                    
                            <p>I also decided to do the second challenge for fun because visual design is an area I am interested in and want to improve upon.</p>
                            <p>Since the goal is to have people click on the CTA, I made the button big and bright using Mercari colors. I wanted to create movement within the image to guide the eyes towards the CTA. The tree subtly points to the text as well as the CTA button and as the eyes move left to right, the snowan's face and scarf point back towards the center to direct the eyes to the CTA. The small background icons are meant to be subtle, to create some depth as well as speak to Mercari's main target market.</p>
