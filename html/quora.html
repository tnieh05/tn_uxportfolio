                <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Quora has built a community around the sharing of information and experiences. It is a great resource for those looking for answers from subject experts and those who've had first hand accounts in specific situations. Because Quora is widely used as a resource, being able to quickly save and access information is an important feature that is often overlooked. </p>

                    <h4>Guerilla Usability Testing</h4>
                    
                        <p>From my personal usage of Quora, I noticed that the bookmarking function was confusing. Curious to see if others thought the same, I gave each user a scenario to imagine while I observed their interaction with the Quora app. I selected testers who I assumed could be typical users of Quora: students and professionals.
                        </p>       
                        <p><b>The scenario:</b> Imagine you are researching [topic user chooses], but you don't have much time and want to save the information for later. </p>
                        <p>I interviewed a total of 5 users and noted their reponses and reactions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Observations</h4>

                        <p>I recorded each observation and quote on individual sticky notes and organized them by pain points. From the affinity map, I was able to determine the following: </p>
                        <!--<ul>
                                <li><p>4 out of 5 users had trouble locating the bookmarks</p></li>
                                <li><p>5 out of 5 users had difficulty deleting bookmarks</p></li>
                                <li><p>4 out of 5 users could not differentiate between bookmarked topics and bookmarked answers</p></li>
                            </ul>-->

The proto-persona I created is based on assumptions I made of a typical Quora user. Note: Due to time restrictions I placed on myself, I was not able to validate this persona. </p>

                    <h4>Scenario</h4>
                        <p>The scenario brought to life what a typical user may experience while using the Quora app. Creating a scenario helped me empathize with the user and imagine different situations in which they may use the bookmark function of the app.</p>

                        <p>I sketched out several wireframes that could potentially address the issues noted above. While doing so, a couple of questions came to mind: "How can I design minimally so the user does not need to re-learn the flow?, "Is this design beneficial to the user and the company?"   </p>

                        <p> During my hi-fidelity prototype testing, 5 out of 5 users tested were able to easily find the bookmarks. All 5 went to their user profile section and immediately clicked on the bookmarked link. 5 out of 5 users also had no trouble deleting the bookmarked topics and answers. </p>
