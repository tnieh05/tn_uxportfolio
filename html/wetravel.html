                    <p>Through our changes, we were able to get 100% of users to correctly identify the target market and were successful in getting 60% of users to correctly calculate the pricing for WeTravel. We made the pricing more transparent and easy to understand and also improved clarity on the landing page. By the end of our cycles, we were able to increase user engagement and clicks on the call to action button. </p>

                        <p>Our research phase consisted of user interviews, affinity mapping, card sorting, comprehension tests and competitor messaging analysis.</p>

                        <p> During our experimentation phase, we started with testing the control, which is the original and current WeTravel website. Using the control as the basis for our changes, we began four cycles:

                        <p>For every cycle, we tested 5 new target users. With each cycle, we used the results from the previous one to create a new hypothesis in hopes of reaching our goal.</p>

                <div class="section">
                        <p>Our goal for the landing page was to widen the target market to also include professionals such as DMC companies and Boutique Tour Agencies. Currently, the original WeTravel site appeals more towards semi-professionals (i.e. Yoga and MBA Students). </p>
                    <h3>Control</h3>
                        <p>We started with testing the original WeTravel page so that we would have a control to compare our results to.</p>
                        <p>During the user interviews, we asked them to answer a simple question, "Who do you think this site is for?"</p>
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                        <p>Only 20% were able to correctly identify the target market.</p>
