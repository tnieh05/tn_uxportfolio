                        <p>We started with testing the original WeTravel page so that we would have a control to compare our results to.</p>

                        <p>We found that explaining the pricing in simple terms was most effective and that users did not view the marketing copy positively. If we had more time, I would have liked to explore creating a visual example to accompany the text.</p>
